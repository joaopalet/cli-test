# JP CLI

A CLI built to test distributions with Homebrew and Snapcraft.

> [!WARNING]
> Starting on July 9 2024, the new STACKIT Identity Provider (IDP) will be available.
> 
> On this date, we will release a new version of the STACKIT CLI that will use the new IDP for user authentication. This also means that the **user authentication on STACKIT CLI versions released before July 9 2024 is no longer guaranteed to work for all services**.
> 
> Please make sure to **update your STACKIT CLI to the latest version after July 9 2024** to ensure that you can continue to use all STACKIT services.
> 
> You can find more information regarding the new IDP in the [STACKIT release notes](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/release-notes-23101442.html#ReleaseNotes-2024-06-21-identity-provider).
